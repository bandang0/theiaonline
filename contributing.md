The Theia Project is free and open-source. If you feel like contributing in any manner (and there is lots to do), please contact the maintainer at the address found at the bottom of this page.

We are open to all contributions and hope that the project will grow with its contributors and profit the community of gravitational interferometers.

For developers, a nice way to start is to obtain the latest stable version of `theia` from the [Getting theia](../releases) page and reading the docs found at the [Documentation](../docs) page. Most importantly, read the User Guide and API Guide to get a feel of the project.
