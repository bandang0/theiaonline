Welcome to the tutorials page, where you can learn `theia` by example.

From here, you can jump to tutorial pages on `theia` as a library for scripting or as a command line tool. These tutorials are all based on files which can be found in the `tutos/` directory of the project repository. You can obtain the project releases from the [Getting theia](../releases/) page.

All the tutorial pages are listed here with their corresponding files:

* [First Scripting Tutorial](basic-scripting-tutorial.html): about basic scripting with `theia`, treats the `optimization.py` file,
* [First CLI Tutorial](first-cli-tutorial.html): on first usage of `theia` as a command tool, treats the `alloptics.tia`file,
* [The Implementation of Gaussian Optics in theia](optics-implementation.html): on where and how the calculation of daughter beam curvatures is done in theia,
* [Enhancing theia with more Optics](enhancing-optics.html): on adding optical components to theia,
* [Enhancing theia's Output](enhancing-output.html): on customizing the output of theia.
