* [QuickRef](quickref.pdf): A compact and handy reference to the `.tia` input files syntax for the theia CLI tool.

### Online API documentation
You can can also read the API documentation right here with the [online API documentation](html/index.html) (kindly generated by [`epydoc`](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net)).


### Theia Project Documentation
If you would like to read on the Theia Project itself, you will find the project [report](theia_report.pdf) as well as the presentation for its [defense](theia_defense.pdf).

Some more documentation is:

* [Talk at the Virgo Week in July 2017](theiaforvirgo.pdf): Presentation of the Theia Project at the Virgo Week in 2017.
* [theia Primer](primer.pdf): A quick presentation of `theia` in the course of development.

### Former documentation
On theiaonline we keep only the most recent documentation. If you are looking for the documentation of an older version of `theia`, we recommend you download the version you are looking for from the [Getting Theia](../releases) page and build the documentation yourself, as it is described in the `README.md` file.
