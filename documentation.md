### `theia` documentation
The documentation for the `theia` program and library can be found in the following list:


* [User Guide](userguide.pdf): The theia CLI tool user guide and an introduction to the theia library API.
* [QuickRef](quickref.pdf): A compact and handy reference to the `.tia` input files syntax for the theia CLI tool.
* [API Guide](apiguide.pdf): The formal and extensive description of the `theia` libray API (kindly generated by [`epydoc`](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net)).

### Online API documentation
You can can also read the API documentation right here with the [online API documentation](html/index.html) (kindly generated by [`epydoc`](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net)).


### Theia Project Documentation
If you would like to read on the Theia Project itself, you will find the project [report](theia_report.pdf) as well as the presentation for its [defense](theia_defense.pdf).

Some more documentation is:

* [Talk at the Virgo Week in July 2017](theiaforvirgo.pdf): Presentation of the Theia Project at the Virgo Week in 2017.
* [theia Primer](primer.pdf): A quick presentation of `theia` in the course of development.
* [theia Status Update](statusupdate.pdf): A small presentation relating the state of the project right before v0.1.1.

### Former documentation
On theia.hopto.org we keep only the most recent documentation. If you are looking for the documentation of an older version of `theia`, we recommend you download the version you are looking for from the [Getting Theia](../releases) page and build the documentation yourself, as it is described in the `README.md` file.
