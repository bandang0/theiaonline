### Former documentation
On [theiaonline.eu](http://theia.hopto.org:56000) we keep the most recent documentation. If you are looking for the documentation of an older version of theia, we recommend you download the version you are looking for from the [Getting Theia](../releases) page and build the documentation yourself, as it is described in the `README.md` file.
