This release is the first to of which all the requirements are met by the computation farm at Virgo. To download `theia 0.1.2`, go to the [Getting theia](../../../releases/) page.

### Features

Here are the new features implemented in `0.1.2`

* *Clipping*: Clipping warnings are issued when a beam is not completely (to 2 waists) included in the optic it is in interaction with.
* *Anti-clipping*: With the `-a, --anti-clipping` option, anti-clipping calculations (beam passes near optic to close and some of the beam is clipped) are made and corresponding warnings are issued.
* *Loosened requirements*: To meet with the available `numpy` libraries of Virgo, requirements for `theia` were loosened from 1.13 to 1.7 and the code was adapted in consequence

This is the first release which runs on Virgo machines *as is*.
