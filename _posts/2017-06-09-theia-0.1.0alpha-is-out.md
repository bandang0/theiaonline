After nearly two months of active development, theia v0.1.0alpha is out, along with its documentation! To download theia-0.1.0alpha, jump to the [Getting theia](../../../releases/) page.

Now a series of experimental tests, mainly dedicated to the 3D capabilities of the software, should follow. Come back soon and follow up on the project!
