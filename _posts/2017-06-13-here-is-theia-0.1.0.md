After nearly two months of active development, the team is proud to announce `theia 0.1.0` stable! To download `theia-0.1.0`, jump to the [Getting theia](../../../releases/) page.

### Features

For this first stable release, the features are reduced to the bare minimum:

* *Algorithms*: `theia` does non-sequential tracing in optical setups, the optics of which are in general positions and orientations. The optical surfaces are spherical.
* *Optics*: `theia` can simulate the interaction of general astigmatic Gaussian beams with mirrors, thin and thick lenses, and beam dumps.
* *I/O*: `theia` reads the input optical configuration from a text file, the syntax of which is detailed in the User Guide. The only output is the text file which specfies the Gaussian data of all the simulated beams.

### Next steps towards v0.2.0

We will now concentrate on the next version, which should take the first step in the direction of 3D graphics and diversify the available optics. To infinity and beyond for `theia 0.2` with new features and flexibility, stay tuned!
