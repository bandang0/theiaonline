This release increases the flexibility of `theia` and improves the user interface.

### Features

New features of `v0.1.3`:

* *Special optic*: One can now explicitly specify the action of every surface of the component on reflected and transmitted beams thanks to special optic objects.
* *Beam splitter*: Beam splitter objects are now available.
* *Short output option*: The user graphical interface can be greatly simplified by the use of the `-s, --short-output` option.
* *More information on beams*: The graphical renderer shows more information on the beams, particularly on the origin and target optics.
* *Type checks*: When reading the configuration file, the types of the input are checked and warning are issued when the types are incorrect.

### Code improvement

This version of the library has been thoroughly reviewed and optimized. The class structure has also been simplified, allowing for faster execution and more flexibility.

### Maintenance from remote
