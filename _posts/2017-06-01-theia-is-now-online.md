We are proud to announce that the Theia Project is now online! [theiaonline][1] offers `theia` documentation, releases, tutorials, events and more for the community to make to most of the `theia` program and library.

Enjoy learning on the project, the people, the physics, and the next time you write:

{% highlight python %}
import theia
{% endhighlight %}

surf to [theiaonline][1] and catch up on the evolution of the Theia Project!
