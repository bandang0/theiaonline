## Welcome to theia.hopto.org, website of the Theia Project

`theia` is a 3D Gaussian optics simlation software, developed by the Optics Group of the European Gravitational Interferometer.

On [theia.hopto.org](./index.html), you'll find news of the gravitational waves community, the `theia` program, its documentation, releases, lots of tutorials and more! Keep in touch with the Theia Project, comment and contribute to the physics of gravitational interferometers, here online!

## Quick Start

For a quick jump into `theia`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have all you need to compile and use `theia`:
    * Python > 2.7: check the output of `python -V`
    * A pdflatex environment: check `pdflatex --version`
    * The FreeCAD libraries: install using you package manager (`apt` for Debian/Ubuntu, `yum` for SL/RHEL, `dnf` for Fedora, etc.) or download and compile the [sources](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Download)
2. Download and compile `theia`:
    * Get the latest stable version (currently v0.1.1) from the [Getting theia](releases/) page
    * Decompress the archive and run `make install` to install `theia` (or just `make build-theia` if you don't have a pdflatex environment or don't want the documentation)
3. Go to the [Tutorials](tutos/) page to start learning `theia`. You'll find the tutorial files in the `tutos/` directory of the project.
4. For more advanced usage, go to the [Documentation](docs/) page and read the [User Guide](docs/userguide.pdf). Print out the [Quick Reference](docs/quickref.pdf) to have a handy reference to the input format for `theia`.
